# COVID Data Exploration

This project is an exploration of the global COVID data with the 
intention of creating some visualizations in Tableau to compare infection rates and
death rates in countries around the world.

The link to the data source can be found here:
 [Global COVID Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data)

The CovidDataSQLQuery.sql file contains several queries, most of which were utilized
when building the Tableau dashboard, seen below. The goal was to 
build an interactive dashboard where people can quickly and easily compare infection rates
around the world.
